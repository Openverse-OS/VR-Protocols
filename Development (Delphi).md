## Delphi Method for VR Protocol Development

To establish protocols for VR simulations, this project employed the Delphi method: a structured, iterative process designed to build consensus among VR experts from diverse disciplines. The aim was to generate standardized practices, procedures and data-sharing standards that are both rigorous and widely applicable across VR research contexts within the behavioral sciences.

### VR Experts

A panel of 37 VR scholars participated in the Delphi process. These experts represented a broad range of fields, including psychology, marketing, communication, business, informatics, and engineering. All participants had substantial experience in behavioral science research, ensuring the consensus protocols reflected interdisciplinary and methodological breadth.

### Procedure

The Delphi process was conducted over four rounds. At each stage, a protocol or topic was considered to have achieved consensus if at least 95% of participating scholars agreed. When this threshold was not met, additional discussions and meetings were convened to address disagreements and work toward consensus.

**Round 1 (June 2024):**  
Participants were first invited to propose and discuss potential topics for protocol development, drawing on their individual areas of expertise. The primary goal of this initial round was to establish consensus on which topics were most relevant and broadly applicable for the consortium to address. For instance, the panel unanimously agreed on the importance of developing protocols around safety and ethics in VR simulations. In contrast, consensus was not reached on including topics such as the uncanny valley effect, as this issue was considered too specific to avatar design and not representative of the broader challenges in VR interoperability and standardization.

**Round 2 (July 2024):**  
Building on the prioritized topics identified in the first round, authors collaboratively developed comprehensive protocols for each area that had achieved consensus. Scholars contributed primarily to those protocol areas that matched their specific expertiseâ€”some focused on research design and measurement in VR studies, while others addressed technical aspects such as file formatting and asset coding. This approach ensured that each protocol was informed by deep, discipline-specific knowledge and that the resulting procedures and best practices were both robust and broadly applicable. Topics that did not achieve broad consensus in Round 1 were not pursued further at this stage.

**Round 3 (September 2024):**  
All scholars were asked to review, provide feedback on, and indicate their level of consent for the entire list of developed protocols, regardless of their specific area of contribution. This round ensured collective endorsement, encouraged interdisciplinary scrutiny, and allowed for the identification and resolution of any outstanding concerns across the full protocol suite.

**Final Review (October 2024):**  
Following additional revisions, the protocols were circulated for a final review. In cases where the consensus threshold was not met, additional meetings were convened to address disagreements and reach consensus.

### Outcomes

The resulting protocols, made available in this repository, reflect the collective expertise and agreement of the interdisciplinary panel. They are intended to facilitate standardized, interoperable, and open science data-sharing practices for VR simulation research.

### Adaptations and Considerations

The Delphi process was adapted to the interdisciplinary nature of the project, allowing panelists to contribute most actively in their areas of expertise and to collectively determine the relevance and generalizability of proposed protocols. The iterative rounds and high consensus threshold ensured both rigor and broad acceptance of the final standards.
