- **Social Presence** – The feeling of being physically present with another (real or virtual) entity in the virtual environment.
- **Novelty effect** – The tendency for users to respond more positively to new technology simply because it is new, not necessarily because it is superior.
- **Codebook** – A document or tool that defines variables, categories, or codes used in data collection or analysis.
- **Locomotion (artificial and natural)** – Artificial locomotion refers to movement via controllers or devices (e.g., joystick-based movement), while natural locomotion refers to real physical movement such as walking.

- **Virtual humanoids** – Digitally-created, human-like avatars or figures used in virtual environments.
- **Body ownership** – The feeling that the virtual body or avatar belongs to oneself.
- **Agency** – The sense that the virtual body accurately follows the user’s own movements.
- **Social presence** – The feeling of being physically present with another humanoid entity in the virtually enriched world.
- **Uncanny valley effect** – The discomfort evoked when interacting with virtual humans or robots that appear almost, but not exactly, like real humans.
- **Usability** – The perceived ease of use and learnability of interacting with digital assets or systems.
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)** – U.S. legislation that provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** – A European Union regulation on data protection and privacy for individuals within the EU.
- **Biometric** – Measurable physical or behavioral characteristics used to identify individuals, such as fingerprints, iris scans, or voice patterns.
- **End-to-end encryption** – A method of securing data so that only the communicating users can read the messages, protecting them from third parties.
- **Cognitive Load** – The total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory.
- **Institutional Review Board (IRB)** – A committee that reviews and approves research involving human subjects to ensure ethical standards are met.
- **6DoF (Six Degrees of Freedom)** – The freedom of movement in three-dimensional space, including forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotational movements about three perpendicular axes.
- **Latency** – The delay between a user’s action and the corresponding response or update in the system, especially important in VR to prevent discomfort.
- **Interpupillary distance (IPD)** – The distance between the centers of the pupils of the eyes, which must be accommodated by VR hardware for visual comfort.
- **Virtual boundary systems** – Safety systems that define the physical limits of a play area in VR to prevent users from colliding with real-world objects.
- **Screen casting** – Streaming or projecting the VR display to another screen, allowing others to view what the VR user is seeing.
- **UV sanitization** – The use of ultraviolet light to disinfect hardware such as headsets and controllers, reducing the risk of transmitting germs.
- **Motion-to-visual conflicts** – Discrepancies between physical movements and visual feedback in VR, which can lead to cybersickness.
