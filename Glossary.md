- **SDK (Software Development Kit)** – A collection of software tools, libraries, and documentation for developing applications for a specific platform or framework.
- **Source code** – The human-readable instructions and logic written by programmers to create software or applications.
- **Unity** – A popular cross-platform game engine used to create interactive experiences, including VR applications.
- **Unreal** – Short for Unreal Engine, a widely-used game engine for high-fidelity graphics and immersive experiences, including VR.
- **Version numbers** – Identifiers assigned to specific releases or revisions of software, code, or assets to track changes and updates.

### Data, Security & Legal
