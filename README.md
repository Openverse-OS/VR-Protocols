# Protocols Repository

Welcome to the Protocols Repository! 

Here we share a set of protocols for the broad Virtural Reality (VR) reserch community aimed at fostering open science, enabling seamless re-use of digital assets, and promoting collaboration through centralized repositories. These VR protocols were developed iteratively through the Delphi method by a team of 37 VR scholars spanning disciplines, institutions, and countries.

This repository aims to define and standardize a comprehensive set of protocols, including:
- **Technical Communication Protocols:** Specifications for data exchange, networking, and system interoperability.
- **API Protocols/Specifications:** Standards for designing, documenting, and consuming APIs.
- **Organizational & Collaboration Protocols:** Guidelines for contributor interactions, governance, and workflow best practices.
