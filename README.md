# Protocols Repository

Welcome to the VR Protocols Repository! 

Here we share a set of protocols for the broad Virtural Reality (VR) reserch community aimed at fostering open science, enabling seamless re-use of digital assets, and promoting collaboration through centralized repositories. These VR protocols were initially developed iteratively through the Delphi method by a team of 37 VR scholars spanning disciplines, institutions, and countries. As VR technology evolves, these protocols will be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure that open science procedures and replicability standards are maintained. To reflect this ongoing evolution, the protocols are assigned a version number, allowing researchers to reference and revert to earlier versions when conducting studies stemming from earlier iterations of the data-sharing cycle.

This repository aims to define and standardize a comprehensive set of protocols, including:
- **Interoperability:** Specifications for data exchange, networking, and system interoperability.
- **Procedural Standardization:** Standards for designing, documenting, and executing VR studies.
- **Data sharing:** Guidelines for data repositories and author crediting.
